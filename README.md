# 👋 Hey There!

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm Nathan! I'm a machine learning engineer focused on bringing ML from experimentation all the way to production. In particular, I enjoy building systems that can solve real problems and that have an actual, tangible impact on people. I also like to work on things related to developer experience because why not make things easy to use.

I've worked in FinTech and logistics, working on things like in-house KYC systems and demand forecasting. I've also helped build an ML stack from scratch in my current org as the first MLE hire.

## ✍️ Writing

Lately, I've been working on documenting things I come across or learn -- could be anything from technical deep dives to growing as an engineer.

You can find all my writing in this repository: [writing](https://github.com/jdcabreza/writing).

## 🧪 Projects

I'm looking to start putting up projects on GitHub again real soon. Mostly just fun experiments for my own learning or some tooling that can help with DevEx.
