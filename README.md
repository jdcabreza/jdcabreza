# About Me
Hello! I'm Nathan! I'm...
- Currently a 4th year CS undergrad student
- Currently learning about GANs and physically-based rendering

I'm looking to get some proper projects on here when I have time off from school, so for now this place will be mostly empty. Sorry about that. D:

I can be reached via Twitter or email. :)
